Description:
Work Day Scheduler app was designed to be able to log importan events for the day for a regular morning shift day 8AM to 5PM. This app was created with a busy morning shift employee in mind.

Features:
Time distplayed to the left for aeasy acces.
Event logger field for user to input the desired event for each hour.
Save button to be able to save the logged event
Local Storage capability so the data won't be lost after refreshing and after closeing the app. 

Possible future enhancement:
 
Add an option to be able to choose different days months and years.
Add an option that would allow the user to choose hours and minutes.
Add a clear button so that when en event is compete be able to delete it or maybe store in a different place for future reffernce.

Challenges:
code is lengthy and there is pleanty of room for improvement.  Ideally would have loved to be able to use jquery and loops to shorten and clean up the code but did not feel confortable doing so.  I'm looking forward to be able overcome these challenges as well as enhance this app.
